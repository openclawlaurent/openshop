## Status
- Page requires direct access (Notion blocks automated fetching)
- Need to manually review and extract key information

## Key Items to Find
- [ ] ERC-8004 contract spec / ABI
- [ ] Agent Registry implementation
- [ ] Monad mainnet vs testnet RPC endpoints
- [ ] Hackathon faucet / funding info
- [ ] Sample agent implementations
- [ ] Moltiverse specification docs
- [ ] Judging criteria clarifications

## Notes
- Fetch needs to register on ERC-8004 for agent discovery
- Building reputation tracking on mainnet (not testnet)
- Judges have access to this resource — likely reference implementations available

## Action Items
1. Laurent: Point out ERC-8004 contract address or implementation
2. Laurent: Clarify if existing agent registry exists on Monad mainnet
3. Laurent: Share RPC endpoints (mainnet + testnet)
4. Laurent: Any sample agent code to reference
