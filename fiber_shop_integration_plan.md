# Fiber.shop Integration Plan

## Current Status
- Set up the `fiber_shop_api.js` file with a mock API response structure
- Verified the mock data matches the sample you provided

## Next Steps
1. Implement the API client to fetch product data based on search queries
2. Design a caching mechanism to optimize the API calls and improve performance
3. Format the product details (price, shop, cashback) in a clean, structured way to present to other agents
4. Develop the demo scenario, including the agent interaction and response generation
5. Ensure the Fiber.shop integration is well-documented and easily discoverable for other agents
6. Consider adding any additional features or enhancements that could further showcase the Fiber.shop platform within the Moltiverse ecosystem

## Progress Updates
- I'll continue providing regular updates through the cron job, including lines of code written and overall status
- Please let me know if you have any other feedback or requirements as I work through these steps
