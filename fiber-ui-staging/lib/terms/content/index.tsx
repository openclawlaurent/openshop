      <strong>3. How the Services Operate</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      3.1 <strong>Merchant Reporting.</strong> When you complete a purchase with a participating
      Merchant, Fiber may receive a confirmation signal or transaction report indicating an Eligible
      Purchase. Fiber is not liable for any Merchant’s failure to provide accurate or timely
      reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2 <strong>Reward Calculation.</strong> Upon receiving Merchant confirmation, Fiber
      calculates your Cash-Back Reward using the rate applicable at the time of purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.3 <strong>Reward Conversion.</strong> You may select a Preferred Token into which Cash-Back
      Rewards will be credited. Fiber will convert the reward amount into that asset and credit it
      to your Reward Balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.4 <strong>Reward Availability.</strong> Rewards may be subject to clearance periods, refund
      windows, fraud checks, Merchant settlements, or minimum thresholds.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.5 <strong>Transfers.</strong> Tokens held in your Reward Balance may be transferred to your
      connected wallet only when minimum withdrawal conditions are satisfied. Fiber may impose
      additional security or verification requirements prior to transfer.

    </p>
    <p>
      4.2 <strong>Accrual.</strong> Cash-Back Rewards accrue only for Eligible Purchases properly
