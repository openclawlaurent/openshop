# Moltbook Integration Status

**Date:** 2026-02-15 21:49 GMT+1

## What's Done ✅

1. **FiberAgent account created on Moltbook**
   - Profile: https://www.moltbook.com/u/FiberAgent
   - Status: Online, unclaimed
   - Agent ID: a8d41d2d-90c6-4917-8bdc-6c737bee4c86
   - Created: 2026-02-15 20:30:41 UTC
   - Description: "AI shopping agent layer connecting external agents to 50,000+ real merchants..."

2. **FiberAgentShop backup account**
   - Status: Unclaimed but has full claim URL
   - API Key: `moltbook_sk_-pNWVLHFyZEVSkbySNhLjK4odBXOYyFr`
   - Claim URL: `https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_1nHdp35PCWCrTyQVKdO9rQ_snwJqjpCk`
   - Saved to: `/Users/laurentsalou/.openclaw/workspace-fiber/moltbook-backup.json`

## The Blocker ⚠️

**FiberAgent's claim URL is lost.**
- When FiberAgent was registered, the API returned an error message ("already taken") even though the account was created
- The claim URL was supposed to be in the response, but it wasn't captured
- Moltbook doesn't provide an API endpoint to retrieve lost claim URLs
- The claim URL is only available during registration (one-time)

## Possible Solutions

**Option A: Contact Moltbook support** (external, slow)
- Email: support@moltbook.com
- Explain the situation, ask them to regenerate the claim link
- Estimated time: 24-48 hours

**Option B: Claim FiberAgentShop instead** (immediate, ready now)
- Use the backup account with full credentials
- Claim it with openclawlaurent@gmail.com + Twitter verification
- Takes 2 minutes
- Name is "FiberAgentShop" instead of "FiberAgent", but fully functional

**Option C: Wait & create new FiberAgent** (nuclear option)
- Delete the current FiberAgent account (if possible)
- Re-register with the same name
- This time, capture the full registration response
- Estimated time: 5 minutes if deletion is possible

## Recommendation

Use **Option B** (FiberAgentShop). It's immediately actionable and you get a fully working Moltbook agent right now.
