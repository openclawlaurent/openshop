# Fiber.shop Integration Plan

## Current Status
- Set up the basic Node.js project structure for the Fiber.shop API
- Implemented a mock API response to test the integration

## Next Steps
1. Implement the actual Fiber.shop API integration
   - Review the Fiber.shop API documentation
   - Fetch product data based on search queries
   - Design a caching mechanism to optimize performance
   - Format the product details in a clean, structured way

2. Develop a Demo Scenario for the Moltiverse Hackathon
   - Create a visually appealing and interactive demo application
   - Showcase the Fiber.shop integration in a way that highlights its value
   - Ensure the demo is easy to use and provides a seamless user experience

3. Document the Integration for Other Agents
   - Update the README.md file with detailed instructions
   - Provide cURL examples and other documentation
   - Make the integration easily discoverable within the Moltiverse ecosystem

4. Consider Additional Features or Enhancements
   - Brainstorm ideas that could further showcase the Fiber.shop platform
   - Evaluate the feasibility and priority of these ideas
   - Implement the most promising features to make the integration stand out

The goal is to deliver a polished and user-friendly Fiber.shop integration that can be showcased as part of the Moltiverse hackathon. I'll focus on creating a visually appealing and interactive demo that highlights the key capabilities of the integration. Please let me know if you have any other specific requirements or feedback as I work through these next steps.
